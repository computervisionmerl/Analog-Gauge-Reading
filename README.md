# Analog Gauge Reading

### New algorithm

1) Image acquisition and pre-processing 
   <br /> a. Ideally need some classification to recognize the type of gauge (analog/digital, tick marks present(y/n), etc.)
   <br /> b. Right now assume it is a numbered analog gauge with tick marks 
   
2) OCR and tick mark extraction
   <br /> a. Run OCR, get bounding box around numbers (and other calibration text --> Varies in every gauge) on the gauge
   <br /> b. Identify certain points relative to the bounding boxes to fit a quadratic polynomial (base of the tick mark region)
   <br /> c. Define a heuristic function to choose another polynomial, both polynomials together encompass the region of tick marks in the image, 
   <br /> d. Mask the original image to extract region with ticks

3) Needle isolation
   <br /> a. Run edge detection on the pre-processed image and run probabilistic hough line analysis
   <br /> b. It is safe to assume that the longest hough line in the image will be the needle (assuming that the gauge takes up the entire image)
 
4) Tick mark labeling and interpolation
   <br /> a. Pair up the tick marks with corresponding numbers (based on contour estimation)
   <br /> b. Fit a polynomial p(x) through the centroids of these contours (ticks and numbers are along similar curves), find the outliers using RANSAC
   <br /> c. Find the arc length along p(x) between the needle tip and nearest labeled tick mark and interpolate to find the reading

### Updates --> Gauges with tick marks

1) Image acquisition and pre-processing 
   <br /> a. Ideally need some classification to recognize the type of gauge (analog/digital, tick marks present(y/n), etc.)
   <br /> b. Right now assume it is a numbered analog gauge with tick marks
   
2) OCR
   <br /> a. Get bounding boxes around numbers (and other calibration text --> Varies in every gauge) on the gauge
   <br /> b. Filter out wrongly detected numbers and non number text and build a lookup dictionary with position and confidence of the predictions

3) Region props
   <br /> a. Extract various connected regions in the image
   <br /> b. Filter out using 2 thresholds, area thresholding to remove small and very large regions, aspect ratio to get only rectangular regions
   <br /> c. Pair the tick mark with the OCR number based on euclidean distance criterion

4) Calculate the gauge value
   <br /> a. Fit a quadratic curve along the centroids of these major tick marks (ones paired with numbers)
   <br /> b. Find the point of interesection of line estimating the needle with this curve
   <br /> c. Calculate arc_length along the curve between needle and nearest major tick mark
   <br /> d. We can compute the reading based on prior calibration of distance v/s value along this polynomial (interpolation)
   
## Update --> Min-Max and High-Low gauges
We don't need to run the OCR. If we have the tick marks representing these boundaries, we can see where the needle is with respect to these boundaries and check whether it reads normal or there is something worrysome.
